# Octavian's Saga

This repository is intended to store a set-cover implementation written in
modern C++. A copy of the assignment shall be provided as well.

**Full completion date:** 06 / 01 / 2023

**Soft deadline:** 19 / 01 / 2023

**Hard deadline:** 19 / 01 / 2023

This project will be made available
[on Github](https://github.com/w1bb/AA-Homework-02) under the **MIT license**
once the hard deadline passes.

## Documentation

The following subsections will provide an in-depth explanation of how the
algorithms actually operate. Please check out the code as well!

### File structure

The project is split into multiple parts, following this file structure:

```
. = The current (parent) folder;
├── Makefile = The Makefile that will be used in order to build & run the
¦              algorithms correctly;
├── README = This file;
├── redemption.cpp = The algorithm that solves the 'redemption' task;
├── rise.cpp = The algorithm that solves the 'rise' task;
├── SAT.cpp = The SAT communication protocol code;
├── SAT.hpp = The SAT communication protocol header;
└── trial.cpp = The algorithm that solves the 'trial' task;
```

### Task 1. Trial

The first task can be easily solved by considering the fact that each card can
only be found in zero or more of the $M$ provided sets. This means that, if one
of the cards is part of the $s_1,..,s_t$ sets ($t\in\mathbb{N}$), a condition
asking for at least one of them to be included in the final purchase must be
set. This can be accomplished using the following formula:

$$s_1\vee s_2\vee ... \vee s_t$$

By doing this for each card, we make sure that each card will be included at
least once in the final pack:

$$(s_{c_1,1}\vee ... \vee s_{c_1,t_1})\,\wedge\,...\,\wedge\,(s_{c_n,1}\vee ... \vee s_{c_n,t_n})$$

 However, this condition is not enough, since we
are interested to check if the problem can be solved using exactly $k$ sets.

By changing the problem and asking for *at most* $k$ sets instead, one could
encode the "at most $k$ constraint" in the SAT query. This can be accomplished
in many ways, but my algorithm implements the **sequential** encoder.

Further information about such encoders can be read here:
- [SAT Encodings of the At-Most-$k$ Constraint](https://www.it.uu.se/research/group/astra/ModRef10/papers/Alan%20M.%20Frisch%20and%20Paul%20A.%20Giannoros.%20SAT%20Encodings%20of%20the%20At-Most-k%20Constraint%20-%20ModRef%202010.pdf)
  (by Alan M. Frisch and Paul A. Giannaros) - this paper contains information
  about a lot more algorithms and summarizes the Sequential Encoder;
- [Towards an Optimal CNF Encoding of Boolean Cardinality Constraints](https://www.carstensinz.de/papers/CP-2005.pdf)
  (by Carsten Sinz) - this is the original paper about Sequential Encoders.

Of course, this will result in *at most* $k$ sets, but since choosing any
unchosen sets would still yield a correct answer, such a method can be applied
to get the requested number of sets instead.
